### About me

I'm chechin. I majored in Mould Injection in university, but I also had a good appetite for learning coding. My dream is creating some little games like the flash game in the past time I growed up.

### This is The First Post I Wrote

I'm going to write something in English. I'm afraid I could not update this blog every day. English is not my native language, but I will try my best to express what I want to say.

### My First Project - a Real Web Game

I've already completed a little project by myself.
It's a complicated tic-tac-toe game.
This is my **CS50** final project. Yes, I got the certificate, finally.

Here's my github and there's build the game on gh-pages and you can play the game immediately.

More info and the rules detail in the manual text in the following link.

This is the project link on [GitHub](https://github.com/wcc356/oni-tic-tac-toe)

I'm going to make a multiply connect system, and a beautiful tutorial.

### This is just the modify the first post

I modified the first default post "hello word", so this post is really basic, just have a chance to write something.Hope I will have time to record the problem I met in CS50, and others before.

These are the websites I read. Really easy to read.

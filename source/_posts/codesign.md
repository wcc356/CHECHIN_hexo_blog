## Why I write this post

When I want to google some problem, I don't know how to express my question. And google always can not type the sign. English is not my mother tongue so I made this table and will upgrade when I learn the new one.

I used [markdown generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to help me make the table.

| sign |          name          |
| :--: | :--------------------: |
|  ^   |         caret          |
|  !   |         tilde          |
|  \*  |        asterisk        |
|  \   |       backslash        |
|  $   |         dollar         |
|  \_  |       underscore       |
|  `   |        backtick        |
|  \|  |          pipe          |
|  {}  | curly braces(brackets) |
|  []  |   (square) brackets    |
|  <>  |     angle brackets     |
|  ()  |      parentheses       |
|  #   |   hash, pound, sharp   |
|  +   |          plus          |
|  -   |     minus, hyphen      |
|  .   |          dot           |
|  !   |    exclamation mark    |
|  ?   |     question mark      |
|  %   |        percent         |
